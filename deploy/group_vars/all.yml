# Specified users will be added to the remote server, along with all specified
# public keys. Removing a user from this list does NOT remove them from the
# remote server! You need to set their state to "absent", remove all the other
# properties for that user, and re-run the "configure" playbook. Also, the
# shadow password (that user's sudo password) should be a hash, and NOT plain
# text!
#
# Generate a shadow password hash using the following command:
# openssl passwd -1 -salt $(openssl rand -base64 6) yourpassword
